description: "The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft is a semi-fictional autobiographical\
  \ work by George Gissing in which the author casts himself as the editor of the\
  \ diary of a deceased acquaintance, selecting essays for posthumous publication.\
  \ Observing \"how suitable many of the reflections were to the month with which\
  \ they were dated\", he explains that he \"hit upon the thought of dividing the\
  \ little book into four chapters, named after the seasons\".\nIt was partly because\
  \ of the seasonal arrangement, and Ryecroft's obvious love of the natural world,\
  \ that the book gained widespread popularity in Japan, being introduced as early\
  \ as 1908 by the scholar of English literature Tokuboku Hirata (1873-1943). Other\
  \ contributing factors were the classic unaffected style, which made the text suitable\
  \ for educational and examination purposes, and Ryecroft's frank assessments of\
  \ society and politics, which may have endeared him to the young academics of the\
  \ country in the early part of the 20th century.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
